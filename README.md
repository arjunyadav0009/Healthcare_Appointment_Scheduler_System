# Healthcare_Appointment_Scheduler_System
This is a simple yet efficient Healthcare Appointment Scheduler System developed in Java. It simulates real-world hospital appointment scheduling by matching patients to doctors based on their medical specialty needs and urgency level.  The system uses Data Structures &amp; Algorithms (DSA) concepts to manage and prioritize appointments effectively.
# Healthcare Appointment Scheduler

A **Java-based Healthcare Appointment Scheduler** that efficiently manages patient appointments with doctors based on **urgency** and **specialty**. This project demonstrates **real-world problem solving** using **Data Structures (Priority Queue)** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

---

## Project Overview

In a hospital or clinic, managing patient appointments can be challenging, especially when doctors have **limited slots** and patients have varying **urgency levels**. This project simulates a **smart scheduling system** that:

- Assigns patients to doctors **based on specialty match**.
- Prioritizes patients with **higher urgency** using a **priority queue (max-heap)**.
- Automatically schedules patients in the **next available time slot** for each doctor.
- Handles cases where no doctor is available and marks patients clearly.
- Displays a **professional, real-looking appointment schedule**.

## Key Features

- ✅ **Urgency-based Scheduling**: Patients with higher urgency are prioritized.  
- ✅ **Specialty Matching**: Patients are assigned only to doctors with the required specialty.  
- ✅ **Slot Management**: Each doctor has a limited number of appointment slots.  
- ✅ **Readable Schedule Output**: Appointments are displayed clearly with patient name, doctor, and time.  
- ✅ **Handles Unavailability**: Patients with no available doctor are marked as “No Doctor Available”.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**  
- **PriorityQueue** for urgency-based patient management  
- **OOP Concepts**: Classes for `Patient`, `Doctor`, and `Appointment`  
- **DSA Concepts**: Max-Heap implementation via priority queue
